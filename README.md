## Hooks:

https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html

"Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class."

## Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to provide examples of class components that can be refactored into function components with hooks.

- The examples range from Button as the easiest to Network as the hardest

- Fetch is an example of how to use hooks with data fetching. Although, this is not currently recommended as the React team are working on a way to use Suspense for handling loading

- Exercise shows a real example that I faced when trying to retrieve state from a child component. It uses useRef and useImperativeRef to achieve this
